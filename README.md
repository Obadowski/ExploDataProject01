##Important note
My native language is _Portuguese_. Therefere, the weekdays in the axis *x* are in *Portuguese* too!

So, for a quick reference
*Sunday* = *Domingo*            || Sun = Dom

*Monday* = *Segunda-feira*      || Mon = Seg

*Tuesday* = *Terça-feira*       || Tue = Ter

*Wednesday* = *Quarta-feira*    || Wed = Qua

*Thurday* = *Quinta-feira*      || Thu = Qui

*Friday* = *Sexta-feira*        || Fri = Sex

*Saturday* = *Sábado*           || Sat = Sáb

If you know portuguese or any other latine language, you will notice that the weekdays in portuguese are related to a sequence of days. I.e. *Segunda* = second, *Terça* = third, and so for. The name *Sábado* is related to the *Sabbath* (similar to English name) and *Domingo* to the *Dominus Dei* or translated from Latin *Day of the Lord*.

Have a nice day! Thanks for evaluating my task!!
